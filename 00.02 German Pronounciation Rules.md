Excellent request 👌 — German pronunciation is very regular compared to English, but there **are rules for each letter and letter-combination**, and sometimes the pronunciation depends on the **position** in the word (beginning, middle, end).

Here’s a structured overview:

---

# ✅ German Pronunciation Rules

### 1. Vowels (A, E, I, O, U, Ä, Ö, Ü)

* **a** → like *“ah”* in *father* (*Mann*, *Tag*)
* **e**

  * short: like *“e”* in *bed* (*Bett*)
  * long: like *“ay”* in *they* (*sehen*)
* **i** → like *“ee”* in *see* (*mit*, *Liebe*)
* **o**

  * short: like *“o”* in *hot* (*kommen*)
  * long: like *“o”* in *go* (*Brot*)
* **u** → like *“oo”* in *boot* (*Hund*, *gut*)
* **ä** → sounds like *“e”* in *bed* (*Mädchen*)
* **ö** → like *“i”* in *sir* (rounded lips) (*schön*)
* **ü** → like French *u* / lips rounded *ee* sound (*über*)

⚡ Rule: A vowel is usually **long** if:

* it is doubled (e.g. *Boot*),
* followed by **h** (e.g. *sehen*),
* or a single vowel before one consonant (e.g. *Name*).

---

### 2. Diphthongs (Two vowels = one sound)

* **ei / ai** → like *“eye”* (*mein*, *Mai*)
* **ie** → like *“ee”* in *see* (*Liebe*)
* **eu / äu** → like *“oy”* in *boy* (*neu*, *Häuser*)

---

### 3. Consonants

* **b**

  * beginning/middle: like English *b* (*bald*)
  * end: sounds like *p* (*ab* → [ap])
* **d**

  * beginning/middle: like English *d* (*drei*)
  * end: sounds like *t* (*und* → [unt])
* **g**

  * beginning/middle: hard *g* as in *go* (*gut*)
  * end: often like *k* (*Tag* → [tak])
  * *-ig* ending: usually [ɪç] like *ich* (*könig* → [køːnɪç])
* **j** → like English *y* in *yes* (*ja*)
* **s**

  * beginning before vowel: *z* sound (*sieben* → [ziːbən])
  * elsewhere: *s* like *sun* (*Haus*)
* **z** → *ts* (*Zeit*)
* **v**

  * mostly pronounced like *f* (*Vater*)
  * in foreign words, like English *v* (*Video*)
* **w** → like English *v* (*Wasser*)
* **c**

  * before *e, i, ä, ö, ü*: like *ts* (*Cent*)
  * in foreign words: like English *k* (*Computer*)
* **h**

  * at start: *h* as in *house* (*haben*)
  * after vowel: makes vowel long but often silent (*sehen*)
* **r**

  * varies by region
  * Standard German: throaty sound [ʁ] (*rot*)
  * At word-end: often weak, almost vowel-like (*der*, *aber*)
* **l** → clear *l* as in English *love* (*lang*)
* **m, n** → same as English

---

### 4. Special Combinations

* **ch**

  * after front vowels (i, e, ä, ö, ü): soft [ç] like *hue* (*ich*)
  * after back vowels (a, o, u): rough [x] like *loch* in Scottish (*Buch*)
* **sch** → like *sh* in *shoe* (*Schule*)
* **sp** and **st** (at beginning of word): pronounced *shp*, *sht* (*Sport*, *Straße*)
* **tsch** → like *ch* in *church* (*Deutsch*)
* **qu** → pronounced *kv* (*Quelle*)
* **ng** → like English *sing* (*lang*)

---

### 5. Final Consonant Devoicing (important!)

At the **end of words**, **b, d, g** become **p, t, k**:

* *ab* → [ap]
* *und* → [unt]
* *Tag* → [tak]

---

### 6. Capital ß (Eszett) and ss

* **ß** = sharp *s* (like *ss*) but **never** at the start of a word (*Straße*)
* After long vowels: ß → *Fuß*
* After short vowels: ss → *müssen*

👉 This is a **complete system**, but it’s a lot to memorize.

Do you want me to make you a **phonetic chart with example words for each rule** (almost like a cheat sheet), so you can practice systematically?
